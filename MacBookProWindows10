How to install Windows 10 on mid 2010 Macbook Pro

Setup
error gpt style partioning - delete all partions
Tried rufus and installing from a usb but this did not work and just paused when loading windows files

Installed BootCamp version 5621, to get all the base drivers on there. This would not install under Windows 10.
This setup:
- Keyboard
- Trackpad
- Wifi

Installed Windows 10 on top
When prompted during the Windows 10 install to update drivers, I didn't.
