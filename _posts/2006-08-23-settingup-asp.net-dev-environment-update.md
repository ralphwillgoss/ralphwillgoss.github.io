I've now moved the Development environment HowTo to the Code Project. The old site will cease to exist in a few days.

You can access the new article here:  
[Setting up an ASP.NET website development environment using Visual Studio .NET, Subversion, and Windows XP](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15271/Setting-up-an-ASP-NET-website-development-environm){:target="_blank"}

Unfortuneately the formatting hasn't ported over very well to the code project style, I will take some time to amend this so its easier to read and follow.
