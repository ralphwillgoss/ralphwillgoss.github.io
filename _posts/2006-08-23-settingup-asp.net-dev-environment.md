Hi,

I've now moved the Development environment HowTo to the Code Project. The old site will cease to exist in a few days.

You can access the new article here https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15271/Setting-up-an-ASP-NET-website-development-environm

Unfortuneately the formatting hasn't ported over very well to the code project style, I will take some time to amend this so its easier to read and follow.
