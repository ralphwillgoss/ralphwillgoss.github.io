I heard [Owen Rogers on HanselMinutes](https://www.hanselminutes.com/113/beyond-continuous-integration-continuous-monitoring-with-owen-rogers){:target="_blank"} and thought I would create a tutorial to show how easy it is to setup CruiseControl.Net as a continuous monitoring server.

My tutorial goes into how to schedule CruiseControl.Net to run at certain times and how to incorporate output from a monitoring program in the build report page for easy viewing for all. Its available here:  
[Setting up CruiseControl.NET to be a Continuous Monitoring Server](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/27832/Setting-up-CruiseControl-NET-to-be-a-Continuous-Mo){:target="_blank"}

You could find all these bits and pieces on the Internet but put together I thought might be a handy reference for people just getting started. Comments, suggestions and feedback welcome!
