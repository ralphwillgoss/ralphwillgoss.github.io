I heard [Owen Rogers on HanselMinutes](https://www.hanselminutes.com/113/beyond-continuous-integration-continuous-monitoring-with-owen-rogers) and thought I would create a tutorial to show how easy it is to setup CruiseControl.Net as a continuous monitoring server.

My tutorial goes into how to schedule CruiseControl.Net to run at certain times and how to incorporate output from a monitoring program in the build report page for easy viewing for all.

You could find all these bits and pieces on the Internet but put together I thought might be a handy reference for people just getting started.
