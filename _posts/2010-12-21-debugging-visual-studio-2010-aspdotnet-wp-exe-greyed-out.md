When debugging with Visual Studio 2010, you may find that you can't attach to the aspnet_wp.exe process as its greyed out.

One solution is to look at the Debug Diagnostic Services, it may be automatically starting and creating new instances of DbgHost.exe â€“ leading VS to think a debugger was already attached.

Disabling this service should fix the problem of aspnet_wp.exe being greyed out.
